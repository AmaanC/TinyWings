An attempt at making a clone of an iOS app called [Tiny Wings](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-wings/id417817520).

Instructions to play are simple:

* Hold the mouse down to get heavier and land smoothly across the surface of the hill
* Leave the mouse to get lighter and fly higher / climb hills more easily
